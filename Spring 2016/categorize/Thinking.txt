1.what kind of problem can the annotation fix?

   - previously looks correct but with wrong type (false fix 646, in anno 525), 
     but not necessarily give correct location. But it is better to 
     give an in time complie warning

   - recursion base case problem 
       first, take out all the recursive function in annotation correct  --- 408 70.1%
       then compare to all bad recursive functions --- 5687 87.39%
       
   - will it also fix the forever loop?

In all anno correct, 525 programs are false fix problems, 57 are not.
among the 57 not false fix problems, 18 are not recursive, 39 are recursive

2. what kind of error can not fix?
